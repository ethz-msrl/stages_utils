# Stage utilities
This repository contains the code to control the three axis stepper and piezo stages.

- Ensure that 24V are supplied to the stepper motor drivers. Connect to the Arduino board using a USB cable.
- Run `three_axis_stage.py` from a terminal and use the `WASDRF` keys to drive the stage to different directions.
- Refer to `three_axis_stage.py` on how to interface with the stage using Python.
